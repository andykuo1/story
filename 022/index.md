A father is sitting in the dark, camped in the living room. His daughter, climbs down the ladder from the attic, holding a box of belongings. She pulls out a few flashlights and places them on the table before plopping down on the ground, opposite of him and begins to fiddle with the things in the box. Her father also has a box of things. They are preparing themselves for the night ahead in a blackout.

FATHER

So (a beat). How was your day?

DAUGHTER

I haven't seen it, fortunately. I guess I'd ask how's yours?

FATHER

A rocky start, but it's getting better, fortunately (a beat). Found anything interesting? Or maybe something spooky to tell (he shines his flashlight up from below his chin)?

DAUGHTER

Doubt it (unamused).

They continue to rummage through their things. Father hands over a tomato.

FATHER

Tomato?

DAUGHTER

One tomato? Did you happen to find half a steak in that box as well?

FATHER

What about a salad?

DAUGHTER

Ah, unfortunately, maybe you missed the year, but I'm trying to find more opportunities to say no. Though oddly, I couldn't find any of those paper towels, timid things. Maybe it's hibernation season.

FATHER

Ah. Who knows. Can you pass me those paper towels?

DAUGHTER

Napkins, it's the scientific term.

Father rolls his eyes.

DAUGHTER (CONT'D)

It's really times like these we need more attentive people, otherwise, they might start to forget the bills and start raising their entire families in darkness.

FATHER

Agreed. The mail people should really get on it and pay more attention to their work habits. That early in the morning (he scoffs)? No wonder nobody gets sleep around here. That plus the dogs. I bet they get quite a few complaints.

Silence.

FATHER (CONT'D)

Why don't you talk to me?

A beat.

DAUGHTER

I'm sorry. Did I dream about that singular tomato? I gotta be honest, it was surprisingly green.

Father tosses the tomato back.

FATHER

No, it's green. I think it got stuck that way after I summoned that ghost with it. Speaking of which, I haven't seen him today.

DAUGHTER

Probably pissed off you didn't call them earlier for the ten past years since they've been dead.

Silence.
