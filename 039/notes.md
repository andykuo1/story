HISTORY

Evokers are given their True Name when they successfully can hold open a Cut and look inside. Each person sees something different in the portal, and this usually helps inform the Elder of a name (chosen by the Elder after hearing what they saw).
After the War began, non-evokers who served in the Evokerâ€™s military were given honorary True Names upon joining.




Conformity?
Horror.
In the Dark Ages, many Evokers were banished from villages by the townsfolk, seeing they bring bad luck. A few lucky ones were able to find refuge in a city by seeking employment from the few remaining governments, but many fled to the outskirts of town to escape persecution. At the edges of the Barren, a Gypsie-like camp forms. A wilderness where no central authority or adjudicator exists. Each either fending for themselves or holding small, tight communities. The land is a precious resource and the owner will defend it (...it is almost like the wild west here).
