Werewolves in the forest are feasting.

Someone is speaking to a gravestone. And they are navigating a changing family situation.

How about a murder mystery?

A bus.

A girl who always gets the leader position but ruins everything.

They arrive at the scene of a burnt corpse. But then a wild hound leaps from the edges and "attacks" Jos. Jos shoots the beast (and misses), but it got scared.

Plague Doctor: Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing on my property— (she notices the beast whimpering) You shoot my dog?

Jos: That's a dog?

Plague Doctor: Oh, you concrete-dodos, I oughta shoot you right now. (she cocks her gun)

Jos: Woah! Woah! I'm sorry. That thing attacked me. Here. Take like— 300 credits. Newly minted those. (he tosses a small coin pouch on the ground, but the lady does not take it).

Plague Doctor: You trespass in here, shoot my dog, and you think you're can just throw money at me— what are you wearing?

Jos: (an inside chuckle) Ah! Amazing, right? You see Crow, people appreciate Garuuvian leather when they see one—

Plague Doctor: Give me that.

Jos: —what? No!

Plague Doctor: You shoot my dog and I keep your fancy blanket. I don't know what world you come from, but that's a fairer trade than any in these parts.

Jos: This is absurd! That things' barely a scratch. (The beast snarls)

Plague Doctor: Either you give me your jacket. Or I'll pick it off your corpse after I put these bullets in it. Which'll it be?

Jos and Crow find the diary of the late Lolly in a town in the middle of nowhere.

Plague Doctor: Garuuvian leather. That's off-market these days from what I 'member. Probably fetchin' a mighty penny.

The Plague Doctor raises her gun, cocked, and then begins a calling whistle.

Jos: Oh, oh, no-no-no. No need to call your guys, really. We're leaving. Right now. No games. Seriously. You can take my coin purse. Here. There are like 300 Imps in there. All yours... Crow?

Plague Doctor: Oooh no, sunny. You took a wrong turn this here mornin' and I ain't in a forgivin' mood.

As the Plague doctor steadies her aim for a shot, Crow throws down an emergency shield and tackles Jos to the ground. A sure hit if it wasn't for the shield.

Multiple shots are now flying overhead.

Jos: Ow! Oh man! Why does this always happen to me?

Crow: She's here, Jos. We found her.

Jos: Lolly? Of all the places—

Another shot whizzes by.

Jos: Where?

Crow: She mentioned something about a room. Maybe there's an inn here?

Jos: An inn here? Sweet Magpies, I hope there are nicer people there.

Plague Doctor: Come on out from under there, ya piglets. I only wants ya jacket. No one's gotta get hurt.

Crow looks at Jos.

Crow: Give her your jacket.

Jos, taken aback, completely offended. A gasp.

Jos: You can't do this me. It's my second one this week and I just got it stitched!

Crow: Yea. That's a shame.

A beat.

And the jacket is thrown over the crates they were hiding behind.

Crow: All yours! Sorry about your dog. Deal?

Plague Doctor: At least one offworlder's got sense. Pleasure doin' business. (as she walks back with the jacket, examining it.) Welcome to Wellweeds, outsiders. Now get off my property.

Crow and Jos meet Lolly in the inn. Lolly had a traumatic pass from which she has been on the run for a few years. They finally find her here, picking up the clues she left behind.

She calls on her friends to trust her and not bring her back. When they agreed (Crow reluctantly), she rejoiced, a more extreme reaction than what we would think, as if a huge burden has been lifted from her shoulders. They had fun through the night before going off to sleep. But Crowenthia drugs her, ties her up, and hauls her into the carriage and begins the trek home. Jos feels bad betraying her but goes with Crow.

On the road, under the moonlight, a fog sets in and a creature is heard in the distance.

Lolly wakes up, but doesn't seem to be surprised. She fishes out of her pocket a knife and picks the lock that tied her.

A howl and then an attack. Some large creature is attacking the carriage.

But Lolly eventually releases herself from the trunk and rolls out behind.

Lolly turns to face the carriage going away and says: "I'm sorry." When out of nowhere, the large beast swoops in and tears her off the street. Her left arm was completely torn off and left lifeless on the road.

Crow and Jos leap off the carriage and went in to search for her. They reach a fork in the path and they split up.

Crow eventually finds the creature in a small, circular clearing. The beast is munching away at Lolly's body, which looked charred. She initially tries to attack it with her sword and throwing knives, but they all evaporate away on contact. Finally, she snaps her fingers to bring a flame, at which point the creature erects, interested, and turns to face her. The creature is nebulous and shiny. Otherwordly and grotesque. But upon facing Crow, she can see its face: a distorted Lolly.

Crow: What did you do to her?

It does not respond, but leaps into an attack. Crow throws a wall of flame and leaps to the side. She circles around to the stone pillar at the end where Lolly's half-eaten corpse lies and takes her necklace before dashing back to the carriage.

The creature is chasing her and she pulls out a primitive flare rocket and shoots it into the air. Jos hears and sees the signal, but before turning back, he hears something in the woods. He instinctually pulls his bow and ducks low. He is attacked by a similar beast and is wounded, but barely escapes.

They reconvene on the road and escape on the carriage.

On the last page of Lolly's book:

So it ends there. I'm not sure what happens next. Please give what's left in my bag to my brother. I hope he'll forgive me. And for what we saw back there, I'm not sure what it is, but it is up to you Crowenthia. I wrote in here what I can, but it won't be enough. Be kind to Jos. And I'm sorry.

Detective Peanut

- Apprentice is a swindler that was tailing the veteran detective. Seeing her not get enough customers, she tricked a customer into coming into her shop (not before coming in herself to drop hints about the correct words to say, like "selling chainsaws"). The Master is uncomfortable with this, as she doesn't like liars, but being in a tough spot, she went with it.
