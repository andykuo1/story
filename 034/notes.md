- The townsfolk recall a folktale about a royal family, the Luzitans, that built the castle in the Sanjar-Tulga Basin, beset by the Sanjar and Tulga Lakes.
- They were a loyal family of the Emperor. And the Emperor requested King Luzitan to establish a holding in the Sanjar-Tulga Basin.
- King Luzitan did just that and built a state-of-the-art castle, with his world-renown architect.
- But the Luzitan family curse followed them and soon an invasion by King Ganbolor was upon them.
- With tremendous forsight (or trickery), King Ganbolor easily passed through the defense and ransacked the castle, reclaiming it as the Ganbolor Foothold.
- The entire family was slaughtered, except the daughter who fled with the native Faulkret people of Sanjar-Tulga to safety. But, asking their shaman, she wished to exact revenge upon the Ganbolor king and made a deal with a higher power.
- She did not know, but she made a deal with a demon. The next night, she was possessed and travelled on foot to a lake and was made to drown herself. And her ghost can still be heard at night, whenever you go on a boat to the middle of the lake, her underwater screams as she is forced to stay underneath the water.
- It has been said that King Ganbolor years later fell ill and died for unknown reasons and his kingdom fell into civil war as his sons fought over the remaining lands.
- The lake, now known as the Lake of Luzitan, is said to bring bad luck to whoever drinks its water.
