A bus of strangers. Travelers distantly unperceived yet oppressively connected by the physicality of their seats of this mode of travel. You can see the stray hairs left unchecked or the breakfast stains left half-cleaned. Where simply a short length of vacant air stands solely between you and those people who are passionate about the work they do or excited for the obscure things we all consume. But alas, we ride on with passing smiles or minor greetings for the chance that that is not true. A slim chance that inevitably grows wider as more bodies squeeze in to fill this ever-growing, but ever-tighter, confinement. As more eyes turn aside to those suffering, for many more will fill their seat tomorrow. As more mouths lie shut to those different, for ignorance is worry-less and responsibility is damning. A bus of strangers, that is where we live. And however we got here, this is where we die.
