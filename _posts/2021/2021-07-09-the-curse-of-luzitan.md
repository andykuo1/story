It was in the old ages before even all the Kyrians and all them folks arrived here. There was a noble family known as the Luzitans. They were kind and ruled with reason. A rare but prosperous trait to find in a ruling family, and they kept their people happy.

But above all, they were loyal to the Rajan, their emperor.

One day, the Emperor, fearing an impending invasion from their Northern neighbors, put upon Lord Valardo de Luzitan to establish a new hold on the Northern border. No other lord under the Rajan's rule would take up this request as the land laid so close to Ganbolors' lands, their sworn enemy. But Lord Valardo accepted the task and went on to build the largest fortress situated at the center of the Sanjar-Tulga Basin. No expense spared; there were walls upon walls of fortifications, intricate mechanisms of traps and weaponry, and interweaving hallways that were all expertly laid out and constructed. By the end, it was a castle deemed unconquerable.

And just as the Emperor predicted, a few years after Castle Luzitan was built, an invasion by King Ganbolor was upon them. Initially, Ganbolor lost thousands of his men and could not pass the fortifications.

Although King Ganbolor may be hot-headed and rash, he was, above all, cunning. Some say he managed to capture the castle's architect and tortured them to death to get the castle plans, letting him slip in unnoticed. Some say he had a vision from the God of War himself. Or a few think Ganbolor was simply an expert tactician. But I think, King Ganbolor was no ordinary man. He was not of royal blood and yet swiftly rose to the top ranks of the northern kingdoms. He was given land, armies, and even the title of a king within the span of a few years. Against any odds stacked against him before arriving at Luzitan, he has never before lost. And I doubt that was pure luck. What he has accomplished is unnatural of any man, to say the least.

But alas, King Ganbolor in a single night ransacked the castle and slaughtered all its citizens, including the royal family. No one was left alive.

No one, except the now last of the Luzitan bloodline, the young princess. She managed to escape. She successfully hid in the woods while King Ganbolor continued his wanton path of destruction south into the empire.

But the princess would not stay idle. She swore revenge on the Ganbolor and looked for a Faulkret, of the reclusive, long-limbed, and flesh-eating shamans you hear of in bedtime stories. These stories did not deter her will and she was able to find one and make a deal:

She would give life for a life. To kill King Ganbolor. To have death befall the Mad King before more bloodshed stained her country. To exact revenge for her family.

It has been said that it worked. The King, the then Emperor, Ganbolor would years later fall ill and die for unknown reasons. His vast, but a short-lived empire, would fall into civil war, the lands fought over by his many sons.

But for the princess, a fate fell upon her worse than death. It is said that the night after the deal, she became possessed and walked, barefoot, miles upon miles in the night to a lake. And in this lake, she waded into its icy cold depths and was made to drown herself. She screamed and screamed, but no one heard her under the water. And her spirit was trapped there, forever. To drown for eternity.

You can still hear her screams out on that lake, underneath the water. Many don't believe me and try to take a canoe out to see for themselves. And they always come back a little shaken. They may not acknowledge it, but you can see it in their eyes.

This is the lake in the woods east of here, known as the Lake of Lost Light, or Lake Luzitan. That's how it got its name. And the castle ruins between the lakes? That's Castle Luzitan. Only those who do not know its history call it the Ganbolor Foothold.
