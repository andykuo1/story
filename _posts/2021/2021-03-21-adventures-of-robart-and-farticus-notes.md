Brainstorm

An ending.

What won't happen:

- Conquer an outer demon
- Conquer a pet, to successfully take care of something
- Conquer an inner demon
- Lie successfully.... actually can be good.

Her name is Brain. She lied successfully and now is going to fix it. She regrets it, but...

She confronts the king of her misdeeds?

But what is the journey? What does she learn?

Maybe write something that evokes a feeling.

They care for each other, but cannot express this. Because they are too proud? too different? too not-on-same-level? Do both sides feel misunderstood?

What about an argument scene where one person is just trying to get by? Not win the argument, but hold on long enough to "succeed".

What about a three person argument? That's just hard i think actually....

Writing a Fight Scene

- Both want to win the fight (whatever that means for them).
- Wait until the reader cares. Spectacle is not enough.
- Escalate.
