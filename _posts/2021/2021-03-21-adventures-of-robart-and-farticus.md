*This is another attempt at "Ado Fropha". One day there'll be a complete script for it. Until then...*

Fonticus (Fonty), Robart (Rob), and Claratine (Clara) are in a battle of gods with Aventicas (Avy).

Fonticus and Robart started their adventure out to reclaim their dreams of fairness and adventure. They hold on to their code of honor and set out to help right the wrongs of the people.

But ten years later, old magic, of healing, is overtaken by new magic that can outperform in every way in a very accessible manner. A new ruling class, the general people, is formed. Anyone can use magic and it is easily available, of course not everyone knows yet.

The world F&R set out to right wrongs for have changed significantly, and at this scale, their actions are nearly meaningless. Fixing one issue leads to a dozen others.

A few misadventures realize this for them, before they set out to the city to find the real issue.

The people have power now, but they are just the same as the previous rulers, but with even more dicatorial control (although they claim to be equally represented). Everyone is forced to give their equal share (and unequal for a few).

Fonticus found an order of knights that preserve the old magic ways. In fact, Fonticus is their savior prophesized to fight the incoming evil. Robart is never mentioned.

There is a rising evil that no one is paying any attention to. It is up to F&R to save the world. And they do rather easily too. So quickly that no one actually thought it was an issue. The order of knights is treated as a fraud.

But then, the new magic leads a new group of people to start doing bad things. This is a major concern.

To help them, a wizard in training, Claratine helps F&R on their adventure as the evil group has captured Aventika, her newly wedded wife. F&R&C go on an adventure to rescue her.

But it turns out Aventika is the leader of the group and Claratine, who could not betray Aventika, instead fights a battle against both F&R and Aventika. Aventika escapes with the help of Claratine.

The Final Chapter

Aventika rules the new land with an iron fist and by her side, Claratine, she is battling with her own morals and finding ways to convince Aventika and mitigate the impact on the general people.

Aventika is not evil. She, like F&R, was raised in a local village and found injustice in the world. So she sets out, once capable, to rid the world of such things and bring harmony to everyone once again. To bring back honor and code of actions. Just as F&R came out to do (but failed to). But in the process, she has lost sight of the humanity.

Aventika uses the Old Magic in new ways. And with the help of Claratine, she is able to perform much more. She is a worthy opponent.

Since then, Fonticus has become the new symbol of the Old Ways and many recognize the prophecy.

In the end, although F&R will defeat Aventika, at the cost of Claratine and Fonticus.

The battle was actually a stalemate, since either side, their power escalating to impossible heights, simply ends with Farticus giving his life to save Robart. He also recognizes that if he wins, a new regime will be born and a rebellion of the Old Ways to overtake the new Magic. And so instead, he teleports himself and Aventika into a new dimension, forever locked inside in an eternal war (or so the legend goes).

Fonticus tricks Aventika, when she did her "final" move, that she destroyed the universe and only them 2 remain. But actually, Fonticus teleported them, using a new magic trick, into a marble of emptiness and sealed them inside.

As they float in space. Aventicas realizes her mistake and breaks down (and so does Fonticus). She has lost Claratine and Fonticus has lost Robart forever (Aventicas is usually annoyed with the naivety of Fonticus, but respects his commitment). They are immortal. And so they discuss.

Years later, Robart runs a school to teach the next generation music and in it, he often recites the legend of Fonticus, all but a myth now. Claratine holds a government position and eventually becomes head of the council and hopes to change the world to a better place.

Robart has the marble embedded in an amulet that he wears at all times. Inside the marble, Fonticus is playing dice with Aventika.

The new magic regime still reigns.

Robart is singing the song of the Adventures of Robart and Fonticus, when a little boy comes up to him and, like how Robart and Fonticus fans over the Knight from their childhood, asks about the adventure, whether they were true. Robart affirms but reminds him: "He changed the world. Brought about peace and prosperity. But he never forgot where he came from and the people around him. That is what truly matters. Never forget." And as he says that, we see wooden galleons and other large seafaring ships soar into the sky and out amongst the stars. A new era begins. The world may change, but we will always be human.

The power of the people, although flawed, is immovable. The actions of one person are effect-less against the entire body of the human population. And the only way to effect change is by educating the masses. Righting wrongs may satisfy today's issues, but tomorrow's will still come if no one is taught to fish.

Everyone is so caught up with the new technologies and advancements, that people lose themselves in it. They forget the human part.

We are gods in a world without believers, Fonticus. Those around us worship a faith of some science while true power is demonstrated right before them. I have been doubted and scorned, yet I continue to give them gifts and miracles. Where is their compassion? Their tolerance and their capacity for empathy?

This is not the way.

But tell meâ€” do you not see how we are treated? Like lunatics. I can raise an army of a thousand men a day and they send me a letter telling me to stop their snoring. I have seen their world of science, and it is not an easy one.

We have not been treated fairly, Aventika, I've seen it. But

Why should we not show them the way?
