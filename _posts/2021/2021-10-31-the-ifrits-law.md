## REBEL POV
A heated courtroom of officials, deciding the fate of the Outsiders (the Evokers on the outskirts of town). Someone stands up for the Evokers, trying to plead their case, but are shot down by everyone else. Besides the new law to be put in place, in a secret side conversation, an attack is to be launched against the Evoker’s bastion. Unable to make progress with the politics, the rebel instead decides to take matters into their own hands and ride ahead to the town to warn the Evokers of the outcome of the plan: an attack and a new Law: all Evokers banished from the Empire. They are no longer citizens nor considered Human. They have been renamed as Ifrit.

The rebel’s brother is in the Imperial Army and has been ordered to march out. They are preparing for something. The rebel let’s him know of these details, but he thinks them foolish to commit treason against the Great Empire. He decides to continue to march with the army. He believes they are there to preserve the peace to escort the Evokers out of this land (not there to kill).

The last bastion of Evokers where most Evokers, who have not escaped to the Barrens or taken positions in high offices, survive. About half of the local townsfolk fear for their lives and many have abandoned trade here. The other half continue on with their lives, hoping to make ends meet in these unfortunate circumstances. A small percentage of people try to help the Evokers who have been turned away by others.

The rebel arrives to warn the Evokers, but faces some opposition due to their attire (even under disguise). They are found out to be a rather high ranking official in the Imperial courts, and this does not sit well with the Elder council. Could they be a spy?

In the end, they decide to act on this information and act first, launching an all out attack against the incoming army instead, while they have the cover of night. Many disagree with this action, bringing up that they would be breaking their Oath. But some continue with the plan anyways.

The rebel is silenced in fear that they would betray the cause. And thus, the whispers of war have begun.

## SOLDIER POV
They are marching out of the city towards the outer towns. He notices that they are bringing much more artillery and cavalry than usual. They are much more prepared; the rebel’s words might be ringing some truth.

But then in the middle of the night, he awakes to screams of terror and explosions as they are ambushed by the Evokers. The Evokers, who each have sworn an oath at the start of their training to Protect the People, have turned against them.

The battle is deadly and barely anyone survived. The Soldier was able to escape on horseback, back into town to warn the Empire of the oncoming army.

As he approached the Main Gate, however, the city was already in lockdown. No one was allowed in or out. And just as the sun rose, the Evoker army could be seen marching forward, ready to take siege of the fortress. But the fortress themselves have stationed Evokers on their Magus Towers, cutting those below with efficiency.

Ultimately, the invading Evokers were slaughtered by the defenses and, as quickly as the uprising formed, it is quelled. Those left alive have their hands chopped off and left to die as warnings to all Evokers: they are no longer welcome here.

The Soldier tries to find his sibling amidst the chaos, but are unable to find them. The City is now under strict law and all armed forces are called in. The Soldier is forced to report in. During the next couple days, the Soldier is brought in to be interrogated about the ambush. He overhears that they are planning to launch an artillery attack against the Evoker haven, hoping to avoid direct contact. Casualties were expected and, unfortunately, acceptable. The Solider, worried that his sibling has actually gone to the Evokers haven, decides to escape and leave in the dead of night to warn them about the now certain, planned attack.

As he escapes, he encounters other refugees, leaving by the sewers, hoping to escape persecution. They have a long trek ahead of them and low supplies. They band together hoping to have a better chance to defeat the odds.

The journey was rough and eventually the refugees had to part ways.

When he gets to the Evoker haven, he first realizes to disguise himself, knowing the appearance of an Imperial soldier is bound to draw attention. He goes to the local inn to question a few folks.

He questions one of the locals and convinces one to help him search for a missing person. During the search, the local discovers that the Soldier is indeed from the empire. In fear that the Soldier is a spy, the local betrays them and calls for the guards.

He is soon captured and made a prisoner. Being seen as a “deserter” and now an enemy, he is tried in an informal court and sentenced to hang.

## SWINDLER POV
She is part of the Evoker community, but is not an Evoker herself. Most of those who have blended in with the Evokers are no longer evokers, but share the same culture.

Unfortunately, she is also locked up, having committed a recent crime. The Swindler just so happens to be in the opposite cell from the Soldier and they converse. The Soldier has a revelation about the disparity between the Empire and the Evokers, and recognizes some of the truth his sibling once told him. The Swindler stays to listen, she has nothing else to do either way.
The Soldier asks the Swindler to take his family ring and find his sibling, as his dying wish.
The Swindler agrees, though truthfully she mostly just plans to turn it over for profit. She is to be released in 3 days, whereas the Soldier is to be executed tomorrow.

She was at the meeting when the Rebel reported their findings. She knew this was probably the Soldier’s sibling, but does not tell him. Once she is let out, she immediately tries to sell the ring. But she notices that the world has changed since she was incarcerated. A war is coming and people are busy preparing either to leave or stand their ground. Out of curiosity she asks around for the Rebel while she tries to pawn off the ring. Asking the city guards, no one has left through the gates of the given description. Unable to find answers, she gives up. At the gates, the Soldier’s dead body dressed in Imperial gear is left to hang as a warning to the Imperials.

Being let out, she quickly returns to old habits. And in times of war, her skill set as a thief is valuable to either side.

Although she was born and raised as part of the Evoker community, she has since distanced herself from them. Her parents have since left to one of the major Imperial cities due to her father’s work. He is a renowned cartwright and found better opportunities in the city. She stayed behind to work as an Archivist for the Evoker archives. But the Evokers were strict and did not tolerate her more “fluid” morality, or really just stubbornness to follow orders. Before long, this friction with the Elders catches up to her and she is thrown out. Given her inside knowledge, one of the ne’er do wells took interest and gave her a job. She gladly accepted.

Nowadays, she works for herself, swindling travellers of their gold by selling “ancient” Evoker artifacts. Sometimes real, but mostly fake.

With the city trade running dry due to the rather scared clientele, she decides to pack up and move to one of the port cities for better opportunities.

In the city, she misses Evoker foods (something she loves and now feels homesick for).
A year has passed since then, and she is struggling with the competition here. One day, as she is trying to sell her wares, one of her cloaked customers is asking for a unique Evoker item. Being the local Evoker historian, she often gets these questions. But upon meeting the figure in person, she is asked where she got the ring. The Soldier’s ring, unable to be sold, the Swindler now just wears it among her other rings.

This customer is the Rebel, their tongue cut and a large scar across the face.

* * *

Many skirmishes throughout the following years continued as the scattered Evokers attempt to re-establish a foothold, but the Empire is too well organized and efforts quickly culled.

Sympathetics (also known as Ifers), identified by ordained Inquisitors, are tried in court for Conspiracy and Treason. The penalty: death. Towns that are known for harboring Evokers are quickly scoured by Inquisitors. Those able to escape the grasps fled to the Barrens, where most Humans do not dare to enter as monsters usually roam those lands and its rather dry and harsh environment. But they must make do with what they have to survive.
