An android is running away in the rain. It turns into an alleyway and hides behind a garbage bin. The pursuant runs by, unaware. Relaxed, it sits by the wall, though the rain is starting to affect its circuitry.

40 years later.

A broken android lays slump against the wall. It has long since been abandoned and forgotten; it’s bulky size betraying its own competitive edge against the newer models. Many of its outer limbs and parts are covered in rust. It’s joint squeak with each movement.

Every day, it sat there, being weathered down and forgotten by its creators. Decades has passed.

One day, it was powered on accidentally by a demolition crew. Scared and alienated, it fled.

Because of that, it struggled with the new world and it tries to find familiarity in the world. It returns home to find solace, but no home remains. Within the city, no one even notices the walking artifact. Everyone else has lost awareness and are completely consumed by their own lives. It’s all in the name of human progress.

Because of that, it builds its own home in the wilderness, albeit, the closest you can get to undiscovered land. It’s completing a dream someone once told it. Once complete, it is now safe to do its own thing…though considering its age, its more acute motor functions have long deteriorated. Without a sense of purpose, it simply sits. It does not eat; it cannot die. After sitting for a while, contemplating, it, instead, spontaneously decides to carve on the walls some resemblance of purpose.

The entire house is plastered with abstract glyphs and graphs.

Every few days or so, it would venture into the City to attempt to communicate with its creators. No one understood what it said, nor did many care.

80 years later.

The first house and the few subsequent wood houses have long deteriorated from the newly formed toxic atmosphere and have dissolved into dust. It now lives in a metal sheet shack.

The floor around it is littered with strange symbols, getting more and more erratic as the years have progressed.

But it has stopped. It simply sat there, against the wall, waiting.

Until finally, a new demolition crew finds its abode and decides to give it a chance to return to society and rebuilt as a newer model. Its house and random scribbles are reduced and recycled for the City, while it is hauled off to the Manufacture. Once complete, it can do way more things it could have done previously and now people are paying attention. It has been invited into a community and serves as an assembler, another cog is the wheel of society.
