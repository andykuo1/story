## SCENE A - DEEP OCEAN FLOOR

A black void of nothingness of the deep, deep, dark ocean. Emptiness.

Then, a glowing, deep-sea fish, elegant and graceful with several long beautiful fins and a flourishing tail. It glides through the water in pitch darkness. Its own soft glow revealing the white, powder-like ocean floor.

## SCENE B - DEEP OCEAN FLOOR - OUTER HULL

As it makes its way gracefully along, it eventually arrives at a large metallic structure. It’s size incomparably immense as it sits on the ocean floor. The small radiance from the swimming fish does not even begin to show the curvature of this thing. It’s looks too smooth to be natural, with purposeful lines and rivets in certain junctions. It remains mostly intact, with the exception of a large crack down the center. Perhaps this is what caused its downfall.

But regardless, the fish, blissfully ignorant of such details, swims in.

## SCENE C - SHIP INTERIOR

It swims through the ship, in search of something. We see as it continues through the multiple once lived-in corridors and rooms on the ship, the remains of human advancements. Signs of people once living here, long digested by the ocean floor. Clothes, food, memorabilia, and trophies. Tools and pictures. Tables and toys. Decayed relics of a point in time.

## SCENE D - OPEN FIELD

It eventually makes it’s way into a large open chamber; the ship has been split in half, and within, thousands upon thousands of cryonic caskets, each with a sleeping human, left here, undisturbed. A small light from behind the glass of each casket illuminates the ocean floor into a beautiful scenery. Some are broken and do not glow, and, eventually, all will fade as energy is drained away from each pod’s reserves. This is the last of the human race.

A creak and a groan; a large mass is suddenly moving in the distance, shifting the sands of the entire ocean floor. The disturbance causes some of the casket lights to flicker. The fish itself swims away quickly to hide.

Something is out there.
