The Captain, who is trapped on this alien planet, is the survivor that returns to the home planet, dead.

The Captain leads an invasion back to their home planet, to take it over.

The Captain finds his old society lacking in purpose, or maybe too oppressive? They have an abundance of everything, but also a disregard for everything outside itself.

Itâ€™s a society of extravagance, but also of ignorance.
