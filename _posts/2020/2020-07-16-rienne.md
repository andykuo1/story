## SCENE A - DERELICT - HULL

A woman in an armored space suit is out on a spacewalk, guided by an elastic pipe towards a large derelict vessel. The pipe had finished draining the ship of fluids and is ready to be detached. She twists the release handles and the pipe comes loose.

**RIENNE**

Fluid line’s detached. Ready to pull me back in.

As the pipe slowly retracts back towards the ship, the safety line attached to the woman, once taut, suddenly begins to drift. Rienne notices the missing tension and looks back.

**RIENNE**

Hey! My anchor is loose!

Indeed, the other end of the line is slowly drifting off into space, detached from the ship. A man replies through the comm system built into their helmets.

**SHAWN (VO)**

Sorry, Rienne. But Guillermo was right about you.

**RIENNE**

Woah, woah, what?! Re-attach it! This isn’t funny.

Another voice chimes in.

**FARRAH (VO)**

Hope you freeze out there, traitor.

The ship begins to turn, preparing to leave.

**RIENNE**

HEY! Come back! Let’s talk about this! Farrah! SHAWN!

And the ship leaves. An empty void of space remains and she is left, alone. She curses.

## SCENE B - DERELICT - DOCKING BAY

She makes her way slowly to the open docking bay. Debris of random metal pieces float about and nothing else. But at least there is a door, and it seems like there is still some power as a small light above it is pulsating a dim red light.

She heads over.

## SCENE C - DERELICT - PRESSURE CHAMBER

The door is not locked and opens freely. Within is a small room, meant to depressurize guests to match the inner atmosphere. Not much else is in here, but another door at the other end. The pulsating red light now illuminates the entire room into a glaring shade of red.

She cautiously heads for the control panel next to the closed door. Non-functional, as expected, but she looks around and finds a detachable panel along the wall.

Rienne pries it out and within are an array of buttons. She searches through the list and purposefully switches some on. A click and a whir.

**COMPUTER SYSTEM**

Backup power initiated.

**RIENNE**

Yes!

**COMPUTER SYSTEM**

Warning. Unknown entities aboard. Warning. Unknown--

**RIENNE**

Shut up.

Rienne leans over to the control panel, now turned on, and performs a few flicks. The computer is silenced.

**RIENNE**

Alright. Don’t fail me now.

And she pushes the last button. Another click and a shuddering whir kicks up. The entire room begins to shake. But then, the outer door begins to close.

**COMPUTER SYSTEM**

Depressurizing sequence initiated. Sealing room.

**RIENNE**

Yes!-- Woah!

And she falls to the ground. The artificial gravity has been restored and the lights return to their normal cold white. Additional lights along the floor flicker on as well.

**COMPUTER SYSTEM**

Sequence complete. Welcome aboard.

**RIENNE**

Damn. These corporate systems are no joke.

**COMPUTER SYSTEM**

Performing diagnosis…

She stands up.

**COMPUTER SYSTEM (CONT’D)**

Hull damage found on L3. No leakage detected. Habitability is sustained.

Although the cabin has been depressurized, the computer is repeatedly trying to open the interior door. Something seems to be stuck. She tries to pry it open, but it doesn’t budge.

## SCENE D - DERELICT - HALLWAY

Pitch black darkness. But then we hear shifting of metal against metal, and finally, a sliver of light shines through the crack of the door as it is being pried open by Rienne. Although difficult to open, she succeeds with a makeshift crowbar she found from the floating debris.

The hallway is dark and empty. As she begins to step in, she notices on the ground, from the small illuminance of her headlight, the start of a blood trail.
