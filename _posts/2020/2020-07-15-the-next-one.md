## SCENE A - MOVIE THEATER - PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT

In a public bathroom, a skinny man is washing his hands. He rinses them, wipes, then repeats again. Each time, he is to repeat four times by impulse as divined.

In the meantime, in the back, two other men are using the urinal and complaining about their current life. One of them is furious about the banality of week to week life. Every day he wakes up to work, and every evening he comes home to sleep. Weekends are no different, with familial errands and general life complications. And the other, nods. They both agree and echo each other’s sentiment. How everyday, every week, for the rest of their life, it’s the same; they repeat their work, sleep, then again. Until they die.

When the two gentlemen finish their business, they head over to the sinks to wash their hands. The skinny man has just finally completed his ritual. He heads over to the door and turns the knob. One. Two. Three. Four.

By the time the door opened, the other two men have finished and are heading out as well. The skinny man holds open the door and let the two men leave. They exchange smiles, but the two are still deep in their own frustration and futility of free will. If only things were different, they pondered.

## SCENE B - MOVIE THEATER - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The two coworkers instinctively bid each other farewell and to see them next week. As they have done so so many times before, they part ways, subdued yet dejected.

## SCENE C - MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT

The skinny man returns to a couple of his friends waiting in the lobby of the movie theaters, who are ready to return home and excited about the rest of their weekend. As they walk out of the mall complex, into the open night air, they share jokes and laugh. One. Two. Three. Four. For some reason, the repeated jokes are still funny.

## SCENE D - MOVIE THEATER - OUTSIDE - NIGHT

The skinny man does not miss a chance to partake in the group’s report as they bounce between conversations and flip through topics. Eventually, they all concluded and agreed the movie his friend picked this time was abysmal. Next time, the skinny man will choose the movie.
