## SCENE 1 - EXT. SHIP DOCKS - DAY

The DETECTIVE and the OFFICER are returning from lunch, where they find various SUVs have arrived on the scene, all labeled “ITCA”. Noticing this, they rush over.

**OFFICER DARA**

Woah, woah! What is this?

**DETECTIVE**

It’s okay. I called them in.

He waves to the truck driver.

**DETECTIVE**

Mornin’.

The driver does not respond. An ITCA officer approaches him.

**ITCA OFFICER**

Hello sir. Here are your papers. You can file these to your supervisor. Thank you for reporting, sir.

**DETECTIVE**

Yeah. Not an issue. I figured you guys would want to know…

The detective glances around and notices a swath of armored guards (more like soldiers).

**DETECTIVE**

…about any safety violations on your trade ships-- hey buddy, what’s with all the security?

Then, the ALIEN BODY is picked up and moved into a capsule to be loaded into the back of a truck by multiple attendees. On their back in white: “ITCA”. Dara notices it and immediately shouts, instinctually pulling out her badge.

**OFFICER DARA**

Hey! Put that down! That’s an order.

The detective, noticing the commotion, interjects.

**DETECTIVE**

Hold! Hold on. Where are you going with that? You do not have clearance to move the body; you can look, not touch--

As the detective starts to head over there, the ITCA officer pushes him back in place. The detective is startled at the sudden force.

**ITCA OFFER**

The ITCA is taking over the investigation. It’s in the papers.

The detective is dumbstruck.

**DETECTIVE**

What?

As he pulls out the papers and frantically flips through them, Dara warns everyone.

**OFFICER DARA**

This is an ongoing police investigation! I suggest you all stop touching the evidence if you don’t want me to come knocking at your door!

**DETECTIVE**

Dara, stand down. Since when did the ITCA do active investigations?

**ITCA OFFICER**

Take it up with the department.

And the capsule is sealed away. The numerous ITCA officers are now assembling to leave. The detective flips through the papers once again, checking if he missed anything. It seems to be correct, and it is signed.

A beat.

**DETECTIVE**

Did they just take everything?

Dara sighs, disappointed and dejected.

**OFFICER DARA**

Yep.

## SCENE 2 - INT. CORONER’S ROOM

**ONE-SHOT**

A TOP-DOWN shot of the full ALIEN BODY lying on a metal slab in the center of the room; its skeleton is organized and straightened out on the table to match the human shape. Various metal cutting and analysis utensils (scissors, calipers, tweezers, etc) sporadically decorate the borders. Multiple scientists are working steadily at the body, all wearing the same lab coat and masks, with the back clearly marked “ITCA”. Some are examining all the various contraptions it was wearing, now clearly laid out on an adjacent table and properly sorted (although labelled as “UNKNOWN”).

A scientist returns to the center table, picking up a small incision knife. Everyone at the table takes a breath before they cut open the chest cavity. Within, they find a STRANGE GIZMO. As if procedure, they immediately extract the contraption and place it in a sealed, clear container that is to be carted away. An assistant pushes the metal cart to the side of the room, ready for storage, and then returns to help with the remaining dissection.

CLOSEUP on the STRANGE GIZMO. It looks broken, with various of its outer pieces falling apart and covered with various, rotten viscera. But, a moment later, a small, dim light on its side starts to periodically flash. It seems to have turned on. And no one seems to notice.
