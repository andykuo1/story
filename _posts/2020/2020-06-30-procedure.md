## SCENE 1 - EXT. SHIP DOCKS - DAY

The DETECTIVE and the OFFICER are returning from lunch, where they encounter a swath of armored guards (more like soldiers) and various SUVs. Noticing this, they rush over.

**DETECTIVE**

Woah, woah! What is this?!

The ALIEN BODY has already been moved into a capsule as is being loaded into the back of a truck by multiple attendees. On their back in white: “ITCA”.

**DETECTIVE**

Where are you going with that? You do not have clearance to move the body.

**ITCA OFFICER**

The ITCA is taking over the investigation. Here are your papers. You can file these with your supervisor.

**DETECTIVE**

What? The ITCA doesn’t do crime investigations. Hey-- stop the truck. That’s an order. Hey.

**ITCA OFFICER**

It’s just orders, sir. Take it up with the department.

And the capsule is sealed away. The numerous ITCA officers are now assembling to leave.

A beat.

**OFFICER DARA**

Where are they taking it?

## SCENE 2 - INT. CORONER’S ROOM

**ONE-SHOT**

A TOP-DOWN shot of the full ALIEN BODY lying on a metal slab in the center of the room; its skeleton is organized and straightened out on the table to match the human shape. Various metal cutting and analysis utensils (scissors, calipers, tweezers, etc) sporadically decorate the borders. Multiple scientists are working steadily at the body, all wearing the same lab coat and masks, with the back clearly marked “ITCA”. Some are examining all the various contraptions it was wearing, now clearly laid out on an adjacent table and properly sorted (although labeled as “UNKNOWN”).

A scientist returns to the center table, picking up a small incision knife. Everyone at the table takes a breath before they cut open the chest cavity. Within, they find a STRANGE GIZMO. As if procedure, they immediately extract the contraption and place it in a sealed, clear container that is to be carted away. An assistant pushes the metal cart to the side of the room, ready for storage, and then returns to help with the remaining dissection.

CLOSEUP on the STRANGE GIZMO. It looks broken, with various of its outer pieces falling apart and covered with various, rotten viscera. But, a moment later, a small, dim light on its side start to periodically flash. It seems to have turned on. And no one seems to notice.
