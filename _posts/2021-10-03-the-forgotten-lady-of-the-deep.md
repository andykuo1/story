Day 1

I never would have thought I would leave this place. It has become a home for me.

But Gregor is right. And oh poor Gregor. To be all alone again in that place. When I find the keystone, I will return for you. From that last sailor's tale, the outside world seems hardly a welcoming place. Not for the likes of us anyway. We will have to wait. Just as you've said, We proceed with patience.

There will be someplace among them; I must find it. Hopefully somewhere warm.

Day 2

I have never missed the ceilings of our dark cells even more than now. You would not believe the size of some of these rooms, let alone the giant walls. Even with Light, there was no end to their height; they kept going, farther than I could see. The first time I bore witness to these miracles, I could barely stand. They make you feel so small, like a rat in a maze.

And of rats! You would not believe the size they have grown. Each one could have easily fed us for weeks. If the boys had not littered the corpses with their dirty irons and magicks, I would have made us a breakfast worthy of kings!

They are quite the surprising bunch, my newfound company. Capable, they seem, but undeniably reckless. Though I have to give it to them, their green fervor and blatant audacity to face the monsters of this world with nothing less than the metal and mind they wield is nothing if not inspiring. To me, unwise, but here we are, alive and quite richer than when we first step foot into this cave.

Although maimed and beaten by the ferocity of giant creatures and, frequently, themselves (and a few times to the point of unconsciousness), they still get right back up and push onwards. The resilience of youth. Or the "ignorance of death", as you've reminded me. Funnily, I think it is something maybe we ought to learn to survive out here.

Two of the boys found handfuls of gems of all colors behind a locked door. Ingenious they were. There I was trying to piece together how to activate the locking mechanisms and they just dug a hole around the door and slipped right through. And there it was. You think we would have seen all the ways around a locked door through our years in that place.

And you cannot believe the treasures hidden beneath here. The wealth of these ancient people to have just thrown these away. No wonder they've all succumbed to time and death.

Regardless, we have decided to take a proper rest for the first time today. The room has been cleared of its earlier inhabitants, so it seems have it all to ourselves now. My throat has grown hoarse yelling so much during the heat of battle; it would be nice to take a restful sleep. But tomorrow, another door. Another room. However much I miss my old bed, this new one, however dangerous and repulsive, just feels oddly rejuvenating. Truly, an adventure awaits for me my friend. And soon, freedom will come.
