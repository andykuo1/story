Anais

It’s showtime boys. They’re searching the cars up front.

Varashim

Damn! This train? It’s a one-way trip to Whippany— don’t they have better things to do?

(Varashim puts on his dust mask.)

Ratagan

They’re looking for us, V! I knew it, and I told you. The goat milk runs deep!

Anais

Ratagan, come on. Stop with the blame game and pack your bag— and give me the sonics. (To Varashim) The credits in the back?

(Ratagan pulls out a metal ball and tosses it over to Anais.)

Varashim

Yeah. Should be under the last trunk; it’s Shell’s case. And the keys (he tosses them over).

Anais

Alright (she catches them). Just like the one back home: meet me underside in 10. We’ll pick up the rest of the equipment after.

(Ratagan yanks open the car door and harsh sand winds fly into the room, whipping up everything in a frenzy. Ratagan’s mouth is wide open and eating sand— but he doesn’t seem to care. He haphazardly puts on his goggles.)

Ratagan

Whew! That’s a storm!— (he holds up two thumbs up; shouting) A-okay boss!

Varashim (shouting)

Rat—let me pack first!

(As Varashim scrambles to catch his flying bedroll; Ratagan is laughing, ecstatic with glee.)

Anais

Alright, let’s give these street beetles something to remember!

(She presses on the metal ball and it activates. It begins to glow and, on it, painted in black, is the letter “V”.)
