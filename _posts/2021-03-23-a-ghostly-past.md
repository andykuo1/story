It also doesn't feel like dialogue for some reason, more that they are talking about something, rather than to them. I think itâ€™s because of delivery. When reading this, you NEED it acted out, otherwise there is no context.

A father is sitting in the dark, camped in the living room. His daughter, climbs down the latter from the attic, holding a box of belongings. She pulls out a few flashlights and places them on the table before plopping down on the ground, opposite of him and begins to fiddle with the things in the box. Her father also has a box.

FATHER

How was your day?

DAUGHTER

I haven't seen it, fortunately. I guess I'd ask how's yours?

FATHER

A rocky start, but it's getting better. Found anything interesting or maybe supernatural?

DAUGHTER

Doubt it.

FATHER

Tomato?

DAUGHTER

One tomato? Did you happen to find half a steak in that box as well?

FATHER

What about a salad?

DAUGHTER

Ah, unfortunately, maybe you missed the year, but I'm trying to find more opportunities to say no. Though oddly, I couldn't find any of the paper towels. Maybe it's hibernation season.

FATHER

Ah, maybe I forgot them. Fun fact though, red meat can kill you. But darling, pass me the paper towels?

DAUGHTER

Napkins, it's a scientific term. It's exactly times like this that we need attentive people, otherwise they might start to forget the bills they pay every month.

FATHER

I agree. The mail people should definitely pay more attention to their work habits. That early in the morning? No wonder nobody gets sleep around here. That plus the hauntings. I bet they get quite a few complaints.

Silence.

FATHER (CONT'D)

Why don't you talk to me?

A beat.

DAUGHTER

I'm sorry. Did I dream about that singular tomato? I gotta be honest, it was surprisingly green.

FATHER

No, it's green. I think it got stuck that way after I summoned that ghost with it. Speaking of which, I haven't seen him today.

DAUGHTER

Probably pissed off you didn't call them earlier for the ten past years since they've been dead.

Silence.
