THERESA, a female of 32, is curled up at a small wooden table, holding with both hands a cup of hot coffee. She is looking wistfully out the window, dejected and unsatisfied. It is gray, dreary, and raining. Opposite her is the cooking stove where GEORGE, a male of 33, is busy making breakfast. Besides the sounds of sizzling oil, this morning is silent. And boring. Theresa lets out a short sigh. Her brows furrowed with annoyance. She calls behind her.

THERESA

George. I think I’ve concluded: the weather here sucks. I’m going to get my students to invent me a time machine for their final project.

George is preoccupied with breakfast and answers with dull intonation and rote rhythm.

GEORGE

Sure, honey.

Theresa turns to glare (at his back) disapprovingly and then returns her gaze out the window. Across the road is the neighbor’s kid, RILEY, a child of 6, who is wearing oversized rain boots and stomping playfully through puddles with unabashed glee.

THERESA

Look! Riley’s out in her rain boots. That’s just adorable (a beat). You ever wonder what it’s like to be a kid?

GEORGE

Weren’t you a kid once?

THERESA

I mean, to just be home and forget everything. And just play in the crappy rain on the crappy street, and not worry about it all. Don’t have to worry about driving the car. Or going to work. Or picking up groceries. Reading papers. And just have fun. You know?

GEORGE

Oh, that reminds me. Did you pick up the groceries yesterday?

THERESA

That was just an example.

GEORGE

No, it’s important.

George finally turns his head around to face her.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Cause are we going to walk up to the gas station to use the bathroom? Again? Cause I need toilet paper to wipe my butt, whether you like it or not.

Theresa scowls and folds her arms. She turns away, dismissing him as she hides her face in her coffee.

THERESA (muffled)

I just forgot them okay?

GEORGE

Oh really?

George brings the breakfast to the table and sits down. A towel over his shoulder, he sets down the fork and plates. It’s a nice, but plain, omelet. Theresa remains silent, looking out the window. George continues to prod.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Remember what you said Friday? I remember someone being really adamant about something.

THERESA

Fuck off.

George becomes stern. He puts down his fork.

GEORGE

Okay. What’s wrong?

THERESA

You keep getting on my case, that’s what’s wrong.

GEORGE

Well, you SAID—

THERESA

Well, I didn’t forget. Okay? I’m was going to pick them up today.

GEORGE

Oh, don’t do that. You said you’d pick them up yesterday.

THERESA

So what? Do you want an apology? I’m going to go get them later. I was busy.

GEORGE

Busy with what? And what do you mean so what? It’s important. You said you so, remember?

THERESA

I got papers to grade for tomorrow— and it’s just a couple of toilet rolls.

GEORGE

I’m not doing this again.

THERESA

Doing what?

GEORGE

What do you want from me? Cause you clearly want something— why are you being so defensive?

THERESA

I don’t want anything— And I’m not defensive. You just can’t take a joke.

GEORGE

Yes, you are.

THERESA

No, I’m not.

Silence. They are sitting at the table, staring at each other.

GEORGE

We’re doing it again, aren’t we?

Theresa takes a breath.

THERESA

We are.

GEORGE

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to blame you.

THERESA

I really didn’t forget, but I didn’t want to go either.

GEORGE

Why not?

THERESA

I don’t know. I felt tired. And I know I promised I’ll go do it— I’m sorry. I don’t know why I couldn’t just go.

Theresa returns her gaze out the window. Silence.

THERESA (CONT’D)

I just. I feel useless here.

GEORGE

Hey, I didn’t mean to say you don’t anything. You are not useless. You do so much. You are taking classes—

THERESA

It’s not that. I know I do my share and work on things. But. I just don’t know why anymore. You know? Like is tomorrow just going to be like this again? You make us breakfast, and I complain about how much our neighbor’s kid enjoys her own life across the street?

GEORGE

You didn’t like the omelet? Sorry (a joking smile), but like what? What do you mean?

Theresa looks at him, tentative.

THERESA

Arguing. And you ignored me.

GEORGE

When did I do that?

THERESA

I was talking about the weather outside and Riley, and you didn’t say anything. All you could talk about was why I didn’t get the groceries.

GEORGE

I did? I… I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention. I’m making breakfast and— I don’t know. I was just already mad that you didn’t seem to care anymore. Like all we said didn’t mean anything to you.

THERESA

What are you talking about? Of course I care, George. I didn’t want to disappoint you; I even set an alarm on my phone to go do it. And I feel terrible for not getting it done yesterday— and I was going to go get it this morning, but you were making breakfast already. And I just— I don’t know. I’m mad that you keep expecting me to do these things and nagging me about them, but I’m also just mad at myself for not just doing it— and these aren’t unreasonable, but— I just don’t know what’s going on anymore. What are we even doing?

GEORGE

I don’t know.

A beat. They both look at each other.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Do you still want to be here?

Theresa sits for a moment.

THERESA

Yeah. I do. Do you?

GEORGE

Yeah. I guess we just have stuff to figure out still, don’t we?

A beat.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Let’s talk about something else?

THERESA

Okay.

A beat.

THERESA (CONT’D)

The weather really sucks.

GEORGE

It does, doesn’t it?

THERESA

You wanna go outside?

GEORGE

Yeah, let’s do that.

Theresa perks up.

THERESA

I’m taking the yellow boots.

GEORGE

Oh— not fair! You had those last time!

THERESA

I called it!
