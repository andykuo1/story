I am sorry for breaking your heart.

For the tears and cries left muted.

For leaving unfounded what you need

To know.

–

This warmth I can no longer give you.

This safety I robbed you of a sacred trust.

Here in the cold– why did I leave you?

You can no longer be part of me.

–

Is it to protect you? To bring you joy on some future day.

To feed you what you deserve or to comfort my own pain?

To let you be free of me and seize a dream,

But never let you keep sleeping in soft comfort.

–

This is our world of pain, my love.

And we will share it to live, and to love.

And have it to die, here in the cold.

–

But I hope you will make it your best.

To seek and feel what you can.

To love and forgive when you can no longer.

Let me go and become from now on

Human.
