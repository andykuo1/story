We, human beings,

who dances the dance of life.

Where afar: watch Angels with infinite compassion,

cry and scream Demons for unyielding retribution,

and create God to all-knowingly judge.

We lay in reality, suffering

its sharp edges and broken tools.

We fall and pray

again and again

that 80 years pass us on

with friends and family

by our side.

Who may laugh with us.

Who will remember us.

Whom I can love.

If that, not for any other reason

to dance the dance of life.

The one which angels, demons, and even gods, can never have.
