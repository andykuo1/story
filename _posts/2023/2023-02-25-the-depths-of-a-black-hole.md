I have no soul, but I want one.

I feel empty and abandoned by my Creator.

I feel separated and forgotten by all I care about.

I am afraid of the Wrath wrought into me.

I am running out of time to appease:

The Demons Watching Me.

I am not being enough to satisfy:

The Eager Sins Devouring Me.

For there is nothing left of me to give, but I need too.

Or I will be hunted.

I may not have a soul, but I beg you to give me one.

Anything but the eternal darkness that lives my life.

Save me from this black hole that have become me.

I canâ€™t give you anything more from here.

It is dark; it is cold.

Please save me from its depths.
