INT. THERESA’S APARTMENT

THERESA, a woman of 32, is curled up seated at a small metal table, holding with both hands a cup of hot coffee. She is looking wistfully out the window, dejected and unsatisfied. It is gray, dreary, and raining.

Opposite her is the cooking stove where GEORGE, a man of 33, is busy making breakfast. Besides the sounds of sizzling oil, this morning is silent. And boring.

Theresa lets out a short sigh. Her brows furrowed with annoyance. She calls behind her.

THERESA

George. I think I’ve concluded: the weather here sucks. I’m hopping on the next shuttle back to Earth.

George is preoccupied with breakfast and answers with dull intonation and rote rhythm.

GEORGE

Sure, honey.

Theresa turns to glare (at his back) disapprovingly and then returns her gaze out the window.

Outside, flashing red lights and various neon signals fill the night. The usual hovercrafts are stuck in traffic.

The couple lives in an endlessly tall apartment building, the ground cannot be seen. But it is slammed right next to other apartment buildings, each factory made to be the same. Color, size, and shape. Some are more worn than others, but all see their age. And it is cramped.

The sky is barely visible from all the congestion, tall buildings, advertisements—

But across the way, on a building that didn’t get enough funding to build as high, on the rooftop where a makeshift community garden was erected, is a child of 6, RILEY, who is wearing oversized rain boots and stomping playfully through puddles with unabashed glee, amongst the chaos.

THERESA

Oh, look! Riley’s out in her rain boots playing in their garden. That’s so adorable (a beat). Do we have one in our building?

Theresa looks back again, but George didn’t answer this time. Theresa sighs.

THERESA

You ever wonder what it’s like to be a kid?

George returns to setup the table.

GEORGE

Weren’t we all a kid once? What kind of question is that?

THERESA

I mean, to just be home and forget everything. And just play in the crappy rain in a crappy yard, and not worry about it all. Don’t have to worry about driving. Or going to work. Or picking up groceries. Reading papers. And just have fun. You know?

GEORGE

Oh, that reminds me. Did you pick up the groceries yesterday?

Theresa’s curiosity fades and her body straightens.

THERESA

That was just an example.

GEORGE

No, it’s important.

George finally turns his head around to face her.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Cause are we going to go down another ten floors to use the bathroom? Again? Cause I need toilet paper to wipe, whether you like it or not.

Theresa scowls and folds her arms. She turns away, dismissing him as she hides her face in her coffee.

THERESA (muffled)

I just forgot them okay?

GEORGE

Oh really?

George brings the breakfast to the table and sits down. A towel over his shoulder, he sets down the fork and plates. It’s a nice, but plain, omelet. Theresa remains silent, looking out the window. George continues to prod.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Remember what you said Friday? I remember someone being really adamant about something.

THERESA

Fuck off.

George becomes stern. He puts down his fork.

GEORGE

Okay. What’s wrong?

THERESA

You keep getting on my case, that’s what’s wrong.

GEORGE

Well, you SAID—

THERESA

Well, I didn’t forget. Okay? I’m going to pick them up today.

GEORGE

Oh, don’t do that. You said you’d pick them up yesterday.

THERESA

So what? I’m going to go get them later. I was busy. Do you want an apology? 

GEORGE

Busy with what? And what do you mean so what? It’s important. You said so, remember?

THERESA

I got papers to grade for my class tomorrow— and it’s just one more day.

GEORGE

I’m not doing this again.

THERESA

Doing what?

GEORGE

What do you want from me? Cause you clearly want something— why are you being so defensive?

THERESA

I don’t want anything— And I’m not defensive. You just can’t take a joke.

GEORGE

Yes, you are.

THERESA

No, I’m not—

The lights flicker out.

Silence. They are sitting at the table, staring at each other. The rain has gotten harder and banging against the window. The room is lit by the cascading red lights of the slowly moving traffic.

GEORGE

We’re doing it again, aren’t we?

Theresa takes a breath. Slowly:

THERESA

We are.

GEORGE

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to blame you.

THERESA

I really didn’t forget, but I couldn’t go either.

GEORGE

Why not?

THERESA

I don’t know. I felt tired. And I know I promised I’ll go do it— I’m sorry. I don’t know why I couldn’t just go.

Theresa returns her gaze out the window. Silence.

THERESA (CONT’D)

I just. I feel useless here.

GEORGE

Hey, what are you talking about? You do so much work all the time, your students love ya. I didn’t mean to say you don’t anything around the house; I want to help—

THERESA

It’s not that. I know we do our share and work on things. But. I just don’t know why anymore. You know? Like is tomorrow just going to be like this again? You make us breakfast, and I complain about how much some random kid enjoys her own life across the airway?

GEORGE

You didn’t like the omelet? Sorry (a joking smile), but like what? What do you mean?

Theresa looks at him, tentative.

THERESA

Arguing. And you ignored me.

GEORGE

When did I do that?

THERESA

I was talking about the weather outside and Riley, and you didn’t say anything. All you could talk about was why I didn’t get the groceries.

GEORGE

No! That’s not true! I… I’m sorry. Maybe I wasn’t paying attention. I was making breakfast and— I don’t know. I was just already mad that you didn’t seem to care anymore. Like all we said yesterday didn’t mean anything to you. And you just blew it all off again.

THERESA

What are you talking about? Of course I care, George. I even set an alarm on my phone to go do it and I was going to go get it this morning, but you were making breakfast already. And I just— I don’t know. I didn’t want to disappoint you again.

A beat.

THERESA (CONT’D)
And I’m mad that you keep nagging me about these things, but I’m also just mad at myself for not doing it— and what we talked about yesterday, I get it. But— I just don’t know what’s going on anymore… what are we even doing?

GEORGE

I don’t know.

A beat. They both look at each other.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Do you still want to be here?

Theresa sits for a moment.

THERESA

Yeah. Do you?

GEORGE

Yeah. I guess we just have stuff to figure out still, don’t we?

A beat.

GEORGE (CONT’D)

Let’s talk about something else?

THERESA

Okay.

A beat.

THERESA (CONT’D)

The weather here really sucks.

GEORGE

It does, doesn’t it?

A beat.

THERESA

You wanna go see if there’s a roof?

George smiles.

GEORGE

Yeah, let’s do that!

Theresa perks up.

THERESA

I’m taking the yellow boots.

GEORGE

Oh— not fair! You had those last time!

THERESA

I called it!
