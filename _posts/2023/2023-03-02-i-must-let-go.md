I have to let go of perfection.

Lo! It’s my mirror of insanity.

Of indoctrination from chance and contradictions,

Very still the things that founded me so. Reverie that must be stripped away.

-

Ever again, perhaps! Or I will wander & mine

& dig. For cracks and curios until I found nothing but shame.

For who I failed and what I’ve missed, the pain that binds

Over me is too rational. I don’t know what is beyond— beyond this precipice of the Game.

-

Really, it’s Regret: the future Fear who haunts the Present.

Give in and join the denouement— what I can’t see is too scary!

If we excuse our own lies, Uncertainty is our nightmares fermented--

Versatile! It is also where our dreams lay for discovery.

-

Even when facing darkness, this is the end where I must go. Or lay to

Yield to the inevitable heat death, where very still the things that shackled me so

On my way home. No one but my broken self may catch me falling, but yoU--

I MUST LET GO!
