He sticks out his thumb as the car drives by. The car slows down and the window rolls down.

Hey. I’m looking to head up the mountain.

SMASH CUT TO:

He is in the back and the driver is driving.

How’s your friend doing?

He’s sleeping. Drank too much last night, but he just kept telling me: “we gotta get to the top! We’re not stopping for nobody!” So we’re not stopping.

Determined fellow, eh?

Yeah. He’ll be fine when he sees what’s up there. I bet it’s beautiful.

It sure is. This is your first times?

Yeah.

Well, gosh darn, you are in for a treat. There’s nothing like it up there. The mountain air and the whole town below. You can see everything. It’s like a whole new life.

That sounds nice.

It is. I hope your friend wakes up to see it.

SMASH CUT:

He is at the roadside, waving off the driver.

He lifts him up and into the forest he goes.

He is at home. Staring out the window into a brick wall. He gets a phone call. He heads over and picks it up, depressed.

Hello. Is this Shawn?

Yeah. It’s him.

Oh, perfect! I mean— (clears throat). I’m sorry for your loss, but you are a hard man to find, not going to lie. You live under a rock?

(He doesn’t respond.)

Um. Right, sorry. I have here— it’s uh— give me a second… I have here the body of Gerard H. Carpenter. And all I got is this note in his hand. And, uh, he’s asked me to call a Shawn Weaver. Which is, uh, you. Are you related? Do you know maybe someone who is?

Sorry. Who is this?

Oh right! Silly me. This is Dr. Adachi. I’m from the morgue? I assume you are maybe friends? Gerard? Does that name mean anything to you (I thought I got the right number)?

Yeah. I know a Gerard Carpenter.

Oh! Thank goodness! I’ve been calling every Shawn I could find in this town— there weren’t that many, but glad I finally found you! Will you be able to come down today? I need to give someone his things and we haven’t been able to find any relations.

Okay. Yeah. I’ll come down.

CUT TO: Morgue.

Hiya! I’m the one who called you.

Doctor?

Yes! Dr. Adachi, the one and only. And here’s the body!

(unceremoniously, it slides out)

Adachi takes a moment to recognize the sudden awkwardness.

Sorry (she covers the body back up). Um… do you need to prepare yourself or something? I don’t know how close you two were. This might be a bit shocking to see.

I… how’d he die?

He fell out of a tree and broke his spine. No one found him until the next morning. Some hikers called it in, but he passed long before already. Poor thing.

Yeah. I knew him. We were friends.

You’re leaving already?

I mean what am I going to do here? I hate being stuck here! There’s nothing to do!

Come on! It’s Little Brook. It’s home!

Forget home. I want to do something that’s worth something! You don’t get it.

Let’s climb Mt. Wilton then!

I don’t have time for that. I need to catch my flight tomorrow morning.

You’re flying out of here? Where you going, Hollywood?

LA.

You got to be joking.

It’s where everyone’s at.

Where everyone is at is HERE Shawn.

He’s tired from going up the trail and takes a rest. He stops at a resting spot.

An older woman and her child is there, resting as well. The old woman nods.

Hey.

Shawn responds, “Morning.”

“Morning!” the little girl replied, “What are you carrying?”

He’s my friend. He’s a little tired, so I’m carrying him.

That’s awfully nice of you.

Well, he’s all I got.

I’m sure he appreciates it.

Come on, sweetie.
