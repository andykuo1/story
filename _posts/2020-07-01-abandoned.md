## SCENE A - EXT. FAIRGROUNDS ENTRANCE

A man, holding a small wooden box, heads into a dilapidated fairgrounds at night. This place has long been closed and abandoned.

## SCENE B - EXT. FAIRGROUNDS MAIN PATH

He wanders down the path purposefully, taking glances at the passing carnival games and shops, long since admired. Along the way, he stops at one of the booths, reaches in behind the counter, and pulls out from a bag a stuffed toy elephant. Receptive of the result, he continues along.

Before long, he takes a turn into a tent and goes out the back. The man seems to be very familiar with this place; he follows an intricate path through all the appropriate doors and side paths to get to the center of the attraction: the ferris wheel.

## SCENE C - EXT. FERRIS WHEEL GROUND

At the base of the ferris wheel, at the gate, is a pile of various toys and trinkets. Some are old, worn from the natural weather, but many are new. He adds the elephant to the pile.

He fishes out his ring of keys and inserts one of them into the aged control panel on the podium. The paint has long since been eroded off. The wheel sputters to life and it begins to turn.

The man watches silently as each carriage passes byâ€¦ one, two, three. Then, he shuts it off, and heads over to seat himself.

As he does so, a long string is pulled from the still inserted key to his pocket. He puts down the box on his lap, and he pulls the string, turning the key. And thus, it turns on again and begins the ascent.

## SCENE D - EXT. FERRIS WHEEL APEX

At the apex of the cycle, the wheel stops. From the box, he pulls out a small, crudely carved figurine and places it on the seat next to him. He sits atop alone and reminisces. Before him, a full, vibrant moonlit scenery.
