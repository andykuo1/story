## INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS

A small dark room containing a single bed and a desk, with an oscillating glow of the band of fluorescent lights built into the walls that ran around every room on this vessel. His desk is a mess, with papers and empty bottles. The captain’s garb is hung up on the desk chair.

The CAPTAIN is undressed and sound asleep. His arm is drooping off the side of the bed.

A now cold cup of coffee sat on the desk as well. But then, a vibration. Ripples can be seen in the liquid. Although initially faint, it was growing stronger.

Multiple people can be heard outside, running and shouting after each other, although muffled. Until--

The ship’s gravity is suddenly shifted out of places and onto the side, causing all the loose items in the room, including the captain himself, to slide across the room onto the wall.

He wakes up surprised and bewildered, grabbing his head (what is happening?). His under garments are stained with the spilled coffee. He grabs his comms off the table, now on its side.

**CAPTAIN**

Bridge, what’s going on over there?

No reply.

Not willing to wait, he climbs the toppled furniture (grabbing his coat along the way) and reaches the door. The door opens and the red flashing light floods into the room, striking the captains face. His eyes now squinting at the chaos out of the door way.

## INT. HALLWAY

The captain is walking briskly down the hall, with his only part of the captain’s coat, albeit unbuttoned, and missing his pants.

Red lights continue to flash, converting everything into a sharp shade of red. Along the right side of the hallway, now the ceiling, is a row of large, wall to wall, windows that reveal a scenic, uncaring vista of the empty speckled space beyond (towards the back of the ship, you can see debris and people floating outwards).

Multiple people are running through the hall, barking orders and carrying supplies. Everyone seems to be in a panic.

**CREW #1**

Close it off! Hurry!

**CREW #2**

Get me something to seal this!

**CREW #3**

We don’t have any more!

The captain calmly calls out to UNIFORMED WOMAN passing by.

**CAPTAIN**

Where’s the XO (executive officer)? Why is no one at the bridge?

The woman initially rushing to aid the ongoing effort, suddenly realize the man was the captain, and answers.

**UNIFORMED WOMAN**

Sir-- I do not know, sir! We have lost all comms-- sir, there’s multiple breaches, and-- we have a code 1, sir! We’re abandoning ship!

As the woman rushes off, a large explosion can be seen through the window. No sound but the back of the ship has erupted into numerous pieces.

**CAPTAIN**

Shit.
