Get up!
The sun’s gone.
The sky has been sealed up
By newspaper flakes.

Stay back!
They’re trying through the window place!
It’s a dangerous world out there...
...even sidewalks are erased...

Settle, my friend. It is winter.

What?

What comes after Fall.
A period of lightless days and clutched sphincters;
It is, unfortunately, just winter.

Winter, you say.
What a crazy world we live in.
And it is here to stay?

Afraid so.
Soon sniffles and illnesses to plague us.
Lateness traffic and cold lunches.
It is here. A season of frozen toes comes.

Huh.
I like it.
Where’s a jar and lid,
Let me catch this winter “bacteria”.

That’s just snow.
You will see more tomorrow.
