Morning Saba.

Why good morning to you! This is another fine day seeing you around again.

Just here for a refill. Tractor’s been going off-course lately. I think something is up with the circuitry. Is Tommal still doing computer work?

Why, for you, I’m sure he’ll get back on the horse. Us and a few folks are actually going to grab lunch today; you have time to join and catch up with us ol’ townies? I’m sure we all miss ya back here; you and your stories of the West.

Oh, sorry Saba. I’d love to see everyone again, but I have my little cousin to pick up at the station. She’s never been to the outskirts, so I don’t wanna leave her alone.

Ah, always the caring one, you. Well, I’ll let Tommal know to call you. And leave the tank here. I can get it refilled and sent back to you— Rena’s heading back up there in the afternoon. She can drop it off, no problem.

Oh, that is awfully kind! Thank you so much Saba!

Stay safe out there! New characters about today. And new customers.

Yes, I noticed you pulled out the old advertisement. That old charm.

Always works, I tell ya.
