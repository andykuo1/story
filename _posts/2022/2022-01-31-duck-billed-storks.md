Once upon a time,

a white lie was heard.

Ten spoons and twenty forks,

Strange and tall duck-billed storks.

They peek and stir near the river brush.

You clasp your lips and neâ€™er find a hush.

Silence, you say to your ducklings.

Patience, your ducklings say to you.

Cause the night comes for everyone.

The night comes for everyone.

Even today, we still sing your bird song.

Sing-a-long, sing-a-long, today or tomorrow.

Ten spoons and twenty forks,

Fine and short duck-billed storks.

There once was a time,

a white lie was told.
