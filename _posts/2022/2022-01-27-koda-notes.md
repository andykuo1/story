2 Lovers who are in disguise. The boy is training to be a wizard in the Royal Court and the girl is helping as a servant, climbing the ranks through hard work.

They have both agreed to go to the city to change the world they live in. And to do so, he must gain favor of the Queen and become the court wizard. To save their old village and end corruption for good.

The Queen takes a liking to him and they begin a relationship.

Although Sienne doesnâ€™t see this happen, she hears about it back in their alcove. The gifts and things the Queen does for Koda.

Until one day, they are at a banquet and Sienne sees Koda being doted on (and harassed). She knows he is uncomfortable. She tries to pull him out, but he ignores her (hoping to not blow his own cover in front of the Queen). So she storms out.

In the morning, Koda returns and searches for Sienne, who has left. After finding her in a spot they used to hang out, they talk.

Sienne: Why would you let her do that?

Koda: Sienne. I got in. They accepted my apprenticeship.

Silence.

They talk about the reason they came here to do. To climb the ranks whatever the cost and achieve their dreams. But Sienne does not want it anymore, not at the steep cost. She asks him to return to the village with her and try again, but he refuses and calls her short-sighted. And thus the ultimatum is given. Sienne loves him and just wants him to do what he will be happy with. And he does too, but knows deep down that Sienne was betrayed by one of the royal families and to get the revenge, he has to become one of these royal houses to achieve this. And he also wants to make the world a better place.

And Koda says no. And Sienne accepts and leaves.

In the future.

Sienne bumps into a group of adventurers that get caught in a kurfuffle with the guards and Sienne helps out. She joins the group and soon becomes the leader. She leads them through many adventures to track down evil and eradicate them. Taking bounties and small jobs to make it through.
