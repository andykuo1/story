Leave yer council, yer lover, yer call.

Cause we take. We keep. We are their Gall.

We know yer buried secrets. We set them free.

We know yer buried vaults— cause we returned it to me!

Cause we are we and we are free!

Go Fortuna! My only city.

Raise yer arms, yer pistols, yer sabers.

Cause we are the wind and they are the liars!

We’ll reap the sows those lubbers grown.

We’ll raise the sails them sailors known.

The Jolly Roger! The Jolly Roger!

Ye best beware, what’s coming for ya.

Ye best prepare, what’s calling for ya.

Cause what ye’s gotten— them’s MINE!

Cause we steal. We pillage. We drink yer finest mead.

Free yer gold and free yer knaves.

Free for all those who can’t behave.

We are yer broken, yer beaten, yer cracked.

Cause we are we and we are mad!

Go Fortuna! Go Fortuna! My only city.
