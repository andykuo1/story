(Two investigators are slowly stepping into the haunted mansion. As their flashlights point upwards, they notice… goo.)

What… is that?

According to Section 12B… ectoplasm.

That’s… evidence, right? Like, real. Evidence.

(The other person flashes his cone of light across the slime, it glistens green.)

Yep. That’s it. You know— it’s kinda cold in here. I should go get my jacket.

(They check their own pockets.)

You know what, I don’t have one on me— did you happen to bring any gloves?

(They are both transfixed at the slime.)

I probably left one in the trunk. Back in the car.

(back in the car. The passenger is flipping through the glove compartment, searching for things. The other is bewildered, biting their lip, brows furrowed, eyes darting around his surroundings looking for danger.)

Gloves. Gloves. Gloves. Notepad. Check. Flashlight—

(The driver pulls up the handbook.)

Section 13. In the event you are possessed, please reach out to your local priest for an exorcism— What is this!? Do you— who runs the church down on Birch?

Some old guy— I don’t know. I don’t go there.

Jesus. Do you think I did?! Why did we have to pick this one— this is your fault, you know. If we just stayed silent and followed the queue, do our work like normal working people, instead of sitting in front of THIS ACTUAL HAUNTED HOUSE!— why did I let you drag me into this. I haven’t even been to church for the past year! My GOD! Sorry (please forgive me.)

You know what, I can’t find that glove anywhere— but we should probably go there first, huh? Get to know who the priest is. Like what if your body got taken over by something, you know? Who do we call? To exorcise…

Yeah, right. We should.

You know, like a ghost…

Do you see that too?

(gulp.)
