The first few pages detail her futile attempts to get out of the tomb. But soon, her attention switches to her own preservation. It appears she dedicates the margins of the pages to tallies and notes about rations and tools. And in the passages, she begins to recount how she got here.

She recalls that she was escaping the burning castle with escorts, riding through the night towards the Capitol to warn the Emperor. But her party was caught and brought to the invading barbarian, King Ganbolor himself.

She was bound and brought to the ritual circle, where she saw King Ganbolor conversing with a dark shadowy figure, twice his size. Its eyes were glowing red. As the acolytes around her began their chant, King Ganbolor took off the amulet he was wearing; at the end of the gold chain was a large red ruby with a perpetually spiraling shadow inside. The amulet was then placed upon her before she was sealed into a stone sarcophagus.

She could not recall how long she was in the sarcophagus, but she managed to free her bindings and maneuver out her boot knife to exit the coffin. Upon opening the lid, she found herself stuck here, somewhere, it seems, underground. And alone.

While she retells her story, she also notes and documents her attempts to find food (mostly rodents) and the water spring she stumbled upon. She also found a locked door that she could not open, no matter what she tried.

She goes on to retell her people's story and their unending conflict with the northern kingdoms, but as she does, her writings sometimes drift off and fixate on random objects in the room before returning to the story as if nothing happened.

And with each subsequent page, this gets worse and worse. Her writing deteriorates and the topic would frequently switch to the amulet. How the amulet was precious. How the amulet saved her life. How the amulet *was* her life.

One day, she noticed.

> I am no longer just myself. I think this solitude is making me lose my mind. Or perhaps this amulet... I must remember who I am. Where I come from."

And she goes on to recall her own personal history: from the early days of her childhood to growing up in the Luzitan family.

But the obsession is clearly getting a hold of her. Many of the passages are just scribbles and nonsense.

Until one of the last pages:

> Do not forget.
>
> You are Amara Getta Dimitro Galamingo Farred (unintelligible) de Luzitan II. You live to serve the light.
> 
> Amara de Luzitan. You are Amara.
> 
> Amara.
> Amara.
> Amara.
> Amara.
> Amara.
> Amara.
> ...
> 

Her name is repeated for many, many more pages. Perhaps months have passed until the final entry:

> Amara... I hunger.
> 
> *Blood for the Gruul-Rift.*
> 
> Amara needs to scream.
> 
> *Flesh for the Gruul-Rift.*
> 
> This head...
> 
> *A soul for the Gruul-Rift.
> 
> Amara has a dagger prepared and it is ready. It will wait at the altar for your command.*
> 
> *The Gruul-Rift will be pleased.*

And no other entries followed.
