Sian, Gruth, and Koda are on a journey for employment in a desert. They make camp.

Maybe?

A lizardman travels North, through the hills and forests, to reach the mountains, where it finds a cave. This is the cave where it documents the legend of its people. The last of its kind to be etched in stone.

It carries a book that it has written in its own language 

It is a historian that only knows one language. It is the lore weaver, but the last of its kind. To ensure their legacy lives on, it decides to draw its history on stone walls of a cavern.

It is the only one left who has escaped the genocide.

Sianne and company travel the desert and find a cave where the lizardman has set up as his home. The walls are covered with legends and stories of his religion. Of his far-off home. In the back, is his resting place, where he paints his own life. And in his hand is the infamous Book of the Weave, the final copy of the historical texts of the lizardman's people.

This is what they were looking for.

Sianne is an outsider and misses home. She relates to the lizardman whose skeletal corpse remains holding the book. And the paintings of his home.

The book is made of thin petrified sheets of wood. The writing is carved with runes of a forgotten language.
