Space Freighter (Space Ship)

AI/Robot — Pilot/ Cargo maintenance? (Zenyatta-like)

Locale: Dock — structured, clean, by-the-books, clipboards and stuff, analog-ish

Start with Spark 2

Necklace around the neck of dead body

Final scene detective thing

Spark:

- A person is trying to leave the planet by boarding onto a ship that is leaving. The ship is not meant for life, being driven by an AI, but the person escaping does not know. Once boarded, they are stuck and they leave the atmosphere.
- Upon docking at the destination, the dock workers open the transport ship and discover a body. They have suffocated (froze to death?) due to the extreme conditions aboard the ship.

Tangents:

- What if the story is centered around the dock workers finding the body.
- Could this maybe become some wide spread news?
    - Like the dock workers worked on some planet that has no idea what happens at the outer rim worlds, and this is the first time the inner planet inhabitants saw an outer planets person, albeit dead.
    - Do they want justice? Are they just curious?
    - Is this strange? Or appalling?
    - A detective comes to investigate, with scientists being intrigued by the remains.
