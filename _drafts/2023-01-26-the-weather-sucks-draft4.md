Theresa looks out the window.

George is making breakfast in the background.

Theresa sighs and is bored. She looks around the outside world and all she sees are people busy with their lives. While she is still here.

Then she sees Riley on the rooftop, coming out to play.

She smiles. Theresa calls to George to look.

But George ignores her.

Theresa smile fades and she looks back at the kid, playing.

And she gets up and takes the rain boots and heads out.

She goes to the roof to play. And while she does so, she has fun! But then she notices an advertisement and she instinctually calls out to George, but he’s not there.

She heads back home and, excitedly, calls George to come see.

But George is no longer there.

She walks the empty room, confused, but also realizing the grief she has been avoiding.

She made breakfast for two, and it’s still there.

She is still wet and she sits down, looking out the window again. Watching the reflection, where she can see George still making breakfast, never turning around.
