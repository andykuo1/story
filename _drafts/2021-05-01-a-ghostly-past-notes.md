Exciting things happen, but is discussed during habitual tasks.

A ticket teller and his wife got overtaken by a trio of well-known bandits. They are waiting for the train to arrive and they are looking for a cowboy. They didn't find him, but the cowboy came out of the train and came to the platform. They have a standoff about horses. Is it 1 horse short? Or 2 horses too many? By his excellent marksmanship, the cowboy shoots the entire trio and survives with a single bullet wound on his shoulder.
