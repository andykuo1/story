Of course, she has no idea, but Shelley is persistent to stick around. She hears a pattern, a surprisingly rhythmic beat, a creeping music out of the surrounding noise…

A shadowy figure is slowly, imposingly, walking down the hall towards the door, in beat. The detective is absorbed in the miraculous tune. A slow, menacing knock on the door, that interrupts the song (crescendo). Silence.

The boss comes in, noticing the disarray, tells her to go home and reorganize her life. She has until tomorrow to make her decision or else she if fired.

She returns home. Meanwhile, Shelley pries into her history, particularly about detective work and the paranormal, of which she has no experience of. Shelley tells her her dreams of becoming a detective, and her as her best partner. Of course, she wants nothing to do with it. But Shelley is currently on a case.

Next morning, she wakes up finding Shelley having made her breakfast and carefully waiting. Of course, she wakes up too late for work and failed the ultimatum. And Shelley has told her that she has told her boss already that she won’t be coming to work and that she is hiring her. They are forming a detective team. They don’t have a salary, they work by commission. And they don’t have any clients. Well, this is her first one.

She was in the middle of her office work when something extraordinary happened. It was a Friday; she was the last to leave. Having been busy moving out of her apartment due to unforseen financial circumstance, she was behind on her work at the office.

As she continued to work, she could hear someone rummaging about, asking for her by name.

She peers out of her office. The receptionist points to her. The person waves to her as they walk into her office.

Sorry. Uh, can I help you?

Silence. The person looks around, then back at her.

No. Actually. Not really.

She sits down, looking around curiously.

Um, uh. Ok, well I am kinda busy here, would you prefer to sit outside?

Nah, here’s fine. Thanks though.

And she continues to sit there.

What a nice little office you have here, do you usually leave all your papers out like this? And is that a window? Dude, nice view. You can really make out the details of this brick wall.

She clears her throat.

Sorry, do I know you?

Oh, right. Sorry, you don’t know me yet. Name’s Shelley.

She extends out her hand. She shakes it, reflexively.

Hello.

Hello to you too.

How do you know me?

Uh, well. Not sure actually, buddy. Pal. Amigo. Bestie.

Do you know what WS stands for? She asks out of the blue. Of course, she has no idea, but Shelley is persistent.

The boss comes in, noticing the disarray, tells her to go home and reorganize her life. She has until tomorrow to make her decision or else she if fired.

A partially torn unicorn shirt is tied to a branch, waving in the wind.

She stands upon her pile of slain foes, looking across the red valley.

The Technical Exorcism Division

- Is up for reevaluation this quarter.
- Luckily however, there are new jobs popping up out of nowhere.

There is a retired detective in town, who use to solve paranormal cases. And everywhere she goes, ghosts would pop up.

Geek Squad has a special division dedicated to paranormal activity that causes problems within a computer, device or anything.

The detective is startled. More silence.

“Hello?”

Instead of a reply, a folded paper is slipped under the door. Interest piqued, the detective goes to pick it up and looks out the door. No one.

She opens the letter and reads it. Terrified, she quickly climbs over her desk to get to the land phone on the other side of the small, cluttered room.

The detective calls the other detective on the phone.

The other is behind a kiosk outside, also devoid of any potential customers. But someone is watching. The other detective receives a call and answers. The detective is also startled by this new information.

The one watching turns out to be the manager, querying about their status of their work. The manager is a non-believer, but because of his boss, is forced to let these imbeciles open an office. However, the monthly evaluation is up and any division could be disbanded for lack of profit. Which the manager is aiming to take advantage of.

Their last big case was their first case when opening this office. After that case, where it got local news coverage, they were able to convince the boss to open a Paranormal division. However, the monthly review is up and reevaluations of the office is in order.

Because of the imminent danger of the office shut down, the detectives decide to leave the office to go door to door to ask for jobs.

This failed, but after a defeat, they hear a scream. They rush to the scene…

The Secret Organization

A group is about to surprise attack our main protagonists. But someone comes to save them. Then, after defeating most of them. Then, another comes in and attacks the other.

Someone possesses a pregnant mother, who is leading an underground startup evil group, but must juggle the responsibilities of pregnancy and evil doings.

Some really kind person opens the door for someone. REally far away. Quite far. And, feeling bad for the person, he/she decides to start running towards the door, causing much more inconvenience.
