This ship was quarantined by the dock master, since it found contaminants from the preliminary Â re-entry scan.

Due to the bio-hazard nature of this situation, the police were involved to handle the matter. Upon opening the ship, it is revealed to be a body with various equipment they have never seen.

With a quick system check, it seems like everyone is accounted for (everyone is connected to the Network).

Someone posited it could be a non-id (someone who lives outside of society, without a registered identification). Some people believed that.

They checked the logs and found no one had boarded the vessel on launch and the equipment was tested functional. Video footage of the departure also did not pick up any signs of someone getting on the ship. It seemed like someone boarded the ship from outside this planet.

Somehow, we find out that the body did not originate from this planet. Knowing this, the police force is now in a panic to control and lock down the information.
