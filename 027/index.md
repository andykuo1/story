I cannot believe it. We are finally off.

Goodbye fishing post. Goodbye fishing net. Norma will miss you.

Strah, where did you put my cooking pot? I thought you kept it in your backpack.

Nope. You, Miles the ever-wise and ever-correct, specifically said: don’t touch my stuff.

I mean don’t take things that aren’t yours and then, also, not put them back. How am I suppose to know where everything is if everyone can just take anything?

I’m starving Miles! It’s been over an hour already— and remember how I told you we should’ve gotten dinner before boarding? And now look at us.

Tera, why don’t you go ahead and ask the sailors below deck. They probably have some grub left over. Cause until I can find where this stubborn fool hid my pots, the rest of you are fasting for dinner.

The rest of us including Norma? Norma does not approve this one bit. (a couple thundering steps) Strah. Give Miles cooking again.

I don’t have it on me— OW! Ok-ok! Don’t have to pull so hard, Norma.

Oh. Sorry. Norma does not know Norma’s strength. Norma will repent and think about this.

No, no. It’s okay Norma. I was just surprised that’s all (ow...).

Ok.

(a chuckle from the balcony) One of your ear’s gonna be longer than the other by the end of this journey, I can guarantee you that Strah. (a beat) Strah, you think we made the right choice?

(a clanking of pans and metal spoons and then a sigh) Don’t know. (a pause) Gilford’s money is bound to dry up soon. So sooner or later, something’s gonna happen. It’s just whether or not we want to be there for it.

Yeah. (contemplative) I just hope he knows what he is doing.

Knowing Gilford? He’s probably got another bag of tricks up his sleeve or some crazy scheme—

I think we did (spoken with a mouthful).

—OH! (bless the traveler) When did you get here Tera; I thought you went to go find some food?

I did. And we made the right choice, no doubt about it (she gulps down her food). New Port’s a fresh start for us and we need that. Not just for Miles, but for all of us.

What was his uncle’s name? Mister Boardash-something something? Sounds more and more made up each time I say it. I mean, why reach out all of a sudden? And right when Gilford left us. You gotta admit, Sianne, that’s a bit too coincidental.

Yeah. I know. It does worry me a bit. But Miles said—

If Miles trusts him, then I do too. Just give him time, Sianne. And stop giving him such a hard time Strah. He’s been through a lot these past few weeks.

I’m not doing anything. He’s the one making a fuss about it.

Well, whatever you guys are doing, stop it. If I have go another day with a late dinner, I’m gonna turn insane. I need some structure in my life.

Hey. What are you all doing up here?

Norma wants to join too.

Oh, nothing Miles— oh (tosses the cooking pot), found your pot in that pile over there. No need to thank me.

Thank you Norma for making Strah give me my stuff back.

Norma obliges. But now Norma is hungry.

Yeah, let’s make something special for our first day out of there! I think I got some of that special firebrandy left somewhere.

I’ll fetch the bowls. Tera, want to grab some chairs?

Copy that.

Norma will get table. But Norma need Strah to find table.

Coming! I think I saw one in the back.

(under her breath, Sianne readies herself) Alright, here we go.
