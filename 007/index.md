## SCENE A - INT. CAGES CHAMBER

A faintly, candle lit stone room. It seems to be some sort of cave but in the center lies four iron cages, each inhabited by an unconscious prisoner, shackled (and some beaten). Two other prisoners are tied, hanging from a pole, their hands tied together above their heads. Many of them seem malnourished.

A man slowly returns from unconsciousness; his body is aching from the cold stone floor. He does not recognize his surroundings and is a bit taken aback at the state of the other prisoners. A startling sound jolts him to panic and scramble back: screaming erupts from beyond in the next chamber, before a impactful splat and silence.

## SCENE B - INT. OUTER HALL

Two figures, dressed in mismatched, makeshift metal plates and leather and their weapons holstered on their hip, are guarding the chamber entrance. There’s no door, just a short tunnel to the inner chamber. One of them, KEEPER GRUSHA, is recognizably pregnant. She is quite relaxed and leaning against the wall, whilst KEEPER RORIK is standing at his post, although starting to lean a little.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Huh. 9 seconds that one.

**KEEPER RORIK**

That one sounded familiar; was that-- Oh, no! That’s the west wing, isn’t it?

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

What did I say. Rookie mistake to go for the new ones.

**KEEPER RORIK**

Damn. I even got him extra supplements last cycle.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Pfft. Nice try but there’s nothing in those. The upper levels get the real ones, trust me. But you’ll learn the patterns. Now pay up, I got an extra one to nourish.

**KEEPER RORIK**

Double or nothing. The next one for sure.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Hm, not another meal ticket. I want your next out-day; my unborn could use a good walk too.

**KEEPER RORIK**

Eh, I can’t. I gave Keeper Gerasim that one already. How about the next one?

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Really? I sometimes worry about you, Keeper Rorik. But you’re on.

Keeper Rorik seems pleased, but Keeper Grusha still seems off put by his previous statement. A moment of silence.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

So Keeper Gerasim seems to be going outside quite a bit, huh?

**KEEPER RORIK**

What? Oh yeah. Don’t tell Keeper Gerasim though; he told me to not talk about it, especially not to Keeper Hania. He doesn’t want to worry her, with their newborn and all.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Yes, of course. It’s just a bit dangerous outside, especially alone.

**KEEPER RORIK**

Oh no. He’s been bringing Keeper Valerie along.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Ah.

A beat.

**KEEPER GRUSHA**

Well I wish them the best.

And another scream erupts as Keeper Rorik begins to excitedly count.
